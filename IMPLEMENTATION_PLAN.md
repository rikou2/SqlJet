# SqlQ Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Single Command Workflow
Implement a simplified command interface:
```
python3 sqlsc.py -u testphp.vulnweb.com
```

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance Enhancements
- [x] Subdomain enumeration (already implemented with subfinder)
- [x] Live URL checking (already implemented with httpx)
- [x] URL discovery with waybackurls (already implemented)
- [ ] Add API endpoint discovery from JavaScript files
- [ ] Add login form detection
- [ ] Implement content type detection (JSON/XML/HTML forms)

## Phase 2: Attack Surface Expansion
- [ ] Implement HTML form detection and POST request testing
- [ ] Add authentication endpoint testing (login pages)
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger detection and endpoint extraction
- [ ] Add WebSocket endpoint detection
- [ ] Implement GraphQL endpoint detection and testing

## Phase 3: Advanced Injection Testing
- [x] WAF detection (implemented with Atlas)
- [x] Tamper script optimization (implemented)
- [ ] Add parameter fuzzing for edge cases
- [ ] Implement second-order injection detection
- [ ] Add error-based injection optimization
- [ ] Add JSON/XML body injection tests

## Phase 4: Automation & Integration
- [x] Automatic SQLMap database enumeration
- [ ] Add table enumeration for found databases
- [ ] Add vulnerability severity rating system
- [ ] Implement distributed scanning capability
- [ ] Add reporting and visualization dashboard
- [ ] Integrate with common issue trackers

## Execution Flow
1. Take domain as input (`-u domain.com`)
2. Perform subdomain enumeration
3. Check live subdomains
4. Discover all URLs for main domain and subdomains
5. Identify API endpoints, login forms and other injection points
6. Test all discovered endpoints for SQL injections
7. For vulnerable endpoints, detect WAF and optimize tamper scripts
8. Automatically enumerate databases and tables
9. Generate comprehensive report

## Implementation Timeline
- Phase 1: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4: 2-4 weeks

Total estimated time: 7-12 weeks for complete implementation
